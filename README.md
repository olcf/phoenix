# Phoenix Cluster Provisioning and Management Tool

![Phoenix](docs/assets/images/phoenix.png)

Phoenix is a library and set of tools to simplify cluster provisioning and management.  It is intended to be lightweight yet powerful.  Its design borrows the best ideas and corrects the worst sins from other cluster management systems used in the past.

Phoenix is currently alpha.  It should be considered a prototype that may significantly change over time.

Documentation is maintained [in this repository](docs/docs) and rendered on [GitHub pages](https://olcf.github.io/phoenix/docs).
